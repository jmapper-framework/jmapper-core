#summary XmlHandler for an easy manipulation of the xml file.

= Xml handling =

As can be compact configuration in XML format, there is always the possibility of error-prone typing it, to reset these risks and speed up its completion, the framework exposes the class *{{{xmlHandler}}}* that has a number of utility methods.

Most of its methods use a java bean *Attribute*:
{{{
         class Attribute {

               String name;
               String value;
               String[] attributes;
               Class<?>[] classes;
    
               // getter and setter...
         }
}}}
The Attribute reflects the parameters of the @JMap annotation plus a string: name, the name of the current attribute.
