#summary configuration of JMapper.

= JMapper configuration =

The standard behavior of JMapper is to find the configured sources starting from the application root. 

to limit the search to a package and its subpackages, you need to create the *jmapper.cfg.properties* file in the application root with the following pair: path.root = package.

For example:

{{{
path.root = com.myapplication.bean
}}}
