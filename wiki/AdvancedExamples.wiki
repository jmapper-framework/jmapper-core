#summary some usage examples of JMapper.

= Advanced examples =

We will see now some very interesting examples of use, which makes the code more concise and elegant.

== Layered application ==

A classic example is a web application that consists of three layers: facade, business and data access.
Each layer has two bean, one of input and one of output.
{{{
             ____________       ____________       ____________
      PivotI |          | BoI   |          | DtoI  |          |
      ------>|  Facade  |------>| Business |------>|  Data    |
             |          |       |          |       |  Access  |
      PivotO |  Layer   | BoO   | Layer    | DtoO  |  Layer   |
      <------|          |<------|          |<------|          |
             |__________|       |__________|       |__________|
}}}
In the architecture of this type, for each service you need to implement four mapping: {{{PivotI -> BoI -> DtoI}}} and {{{DtoO -> BoO -> PivotO}}}.
