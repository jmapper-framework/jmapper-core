#summary implicit conversions are performed between primitive fields and / or wrapper

= Implicit conversions =

JMapper allows to perform mapping between primitive and / or wrapper types, such as from String to Integer and vice versa. Below are represented the conventions used to handle all those conversions that are uncommon:
||*Conversion*||*Result*||
||Boolean -> Number||1 if Boolean is True, 0 if false||
||Boolean -> Char||T if Boolean is True, F if false||
||String -> Char||is taken the first character||
||Number -> boolean||false if Number is equal to 0, true all other cases||
||Char -> Boolean||true if Char is equal to T, false if Char is equal to F, null all other cases||
||Char -> boolean||true if Char is equal to T, false all other cases||
