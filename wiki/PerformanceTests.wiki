#summary The tests performed cover most of the mappings types.

= Performance tests =

JMapper uses the Javassist framework for writing dynamic bytecode, so the generated mapping is equivalent to mapping written statically.
Performance tests are the most difficult to make, because you have to consider different parameters so that the data obtained are real, such as:
 * *JVM warmup*: Running the code will initially be slow and will go worse and worse until you reach the steady state.
 * *Class loading*: The first time you start a benchmark all classes used must be charged.
 * *Just In Time Compiler*: when the JVM identifies a hot part of the code is compiled into machine language.
 * *Garbage collector*: a garbage collection can be invoked during the execution of the benchmark, greatly increasing the time.

All these variables are very well managed by the framework Benchmark downloaded at: http://www.ellipticgroup.com/html/benchmarkingArticle.html.

== Hardware == 

The tests were carried out on a machine with the following features:
 * processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2520M CPU @ 2,50GHz 773MHz
 * RAM: 2,94GB
 * OS: XP sp3
 * JVM: 1.6.0
