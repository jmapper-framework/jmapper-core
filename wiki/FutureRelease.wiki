#summary features of the next release.

= In the next release =

== merge optimized of two arrays ==

the actual operation is:
{{{
String[] newArray = new String[firstArray.length + secondArray.length];
int index = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < firstArray.length: i++){
   newArray[index++] = firstArray[i];
}
 
for(int i = 0; i < secondArray.length: i++){
   newArray[index++] = secondArray[i];
}
}}}
This code is simple but slow, the best way to do this is to use system methods, as follow: 
{{{
String[] newArray = Arrays.copyOf(firstArray, firstArray.length + secondArray.length);
System.arraycopy(secondArray, 0, newArray, firstArray.length, secondArray.length);  
}}}
This algorithm is three times faster and short.

== Errors management of Dynamic Methods ==

errors managed: methods poorly written and null variables as input.

== Added management of primitive types in complex mappings ==

the dynamic mappings between primitive types and complex types as Map,Collection etc.. now are permitted.

== Dependencies update ==

XStream, slf4j and javassist.

== Added printStackTrace ==

To avoid log management a printStackTrace will be added.

== Mapping between collections ==

The order of the destination will be the same of source.

== get method for boolean ==

For boolean types: will be permitted have a "get" method in addition to "is" method.

== OSGI compatible ==

Will be published an artifact with only interfaces to be compliant to OSGI specification.
